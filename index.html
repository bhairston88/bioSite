       </figure><p>Shirley&rsquo;s roots began in Kyle, West Virginia, where she was born the 3<sup>rd</sup> child of seven.  When she was three when her family moved to Columbus, OH.  From a young age Shirley was an avid reader.  Once, despite having no strong religious beliefs, she read the entire Bible because it was the only book in the house she hadn&rsquo;t read yet.  She did well in school and was on the drill team in high school.  She married in 1984 and had two children, Chase and Brooklyn.  She has since divorced and says she enjoys being single because she&rsquo;s free to spend her time however she likes &ldquo;without having to worry about someone else&rdquo;.  She plans to retire soon so she can spend more time in her garden.</p>

        </figure><p>Shirley has a strong interest in the universe at large.  She particularly enjoys studying space and likes to spend summer evenings looking through her telescope.  Since her early 30s she&rsquo;s developed an interest in dreams and dream meaning.  For a time, she practiced tarot card reading and would give readings for her family.  This eventually lead to an interest in spirituality and from there she began to practice Buddhism.  Buddhist, according to <a class="special" href="History.com" target="_blank"> History.com</a>, focus on achieving enlightenment by finding &ldquo;inner peace and wisdom&rdquo;.  Shirley views Buddhism not as a religion but as a way of connecting with the universe.  She also has strong interest in the earth, especially vulnerable areas like the rainforest.  An issue effecting the world that she finds particularly important is that of food deserts.  Food deserts are areas where residents don&rsquo;t have access to affordable nutritious foods like fruits and vegetables and instead must rely on overpriced and scacre items from convenience stores and gas stations.  This issue effects about 2.3 million people in the US.
